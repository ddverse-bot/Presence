# Presence

**Presence** is an experimental, behavior-driven web experience where interaction itself becomes the interface.

Instead of clicks and navigation, the site responds to *how* the user behaves — how fast they scroll, how calmly they move, how much attention they give. The result is a soothing, cinematic experience that feels alive rather than animated.

---

##  Concept

Presence explores the idea that **interaction is emotion**.

- Slow scrolling reveals clarity  
- Rushed movement introduces resistance  
- Calm behavior allows the interface to breathe  

The experience mirrors the user’s intent instead of forcing outcomes, emphasizing restraint, pacing, and perception.

> *Good UX feels invisible. This one lets you feel it.*

---

##  Experience Highlights

- Scroll is treated as **behavior**, not navigation  
- A generative particle orb responds subtly to:
  - Scroll calmness
  - Cursor proximity
  - Time-based breathing
- Text clarity adapts based on interaction speed
- Motion remains low-frequency and non-intrusive

Everything is designed to feel *natural, soft, and intentional*.

##  Technical Overview

- **Three.js** — generative particle orb
- **GSAP + ScrollTrigger** — scroll-based behavior mapping
- **Post-processing Bloom** — subtle cinematic glow
- **Pure Frontend** — no backend, no camera, no AI
- **Performance-aware** — lightweight geometry and restrained effects

---

##  Design Principles

- Restraint over spectacle  
- Atmosphere over noise  
- Behavior over control  
- Feeling over features  

The project intentionally avoids traditional UI patterns to focus on presence, pacing, and emotional feedback.

---

##  Device Support

- **Desktop-first experience**
- Mobile devices display a simplified fallback
- Best experienced with a trackpad or smooth scroll input

---

##  Intended Use

- Experimental portfolio piece  
- Awwwards / CSS awards submission  
- Exploration of interaction psychology  
- Demonstration of frontend motion design and generative visuals
